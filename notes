Pure tile-based platformer is the easiest one to implement out of the four different
types. In pure tile-based platformers, the character’s position, as far as the game
logic is concerned, is limited to a position on a tile grid. This makes collision
detection easy, but limits the control over the character’s movement. Because of
these limitations, pure tile-based method is not suited for platform games that
emphasize action or precision.
The levels in tile-based games are composed of multiple tiles that form a grid.
Each individual tile on the grid includes information about what sprite it uses, what
kind of sounds the make etc. Even the characters in pure tile-based games are
composed of one or more tiles that are bound together. Though the movement of
the character is limited to a grid in the logic, it can be made to look fluid with
animations.
